# Blog Lyfe

##### This is going to be a full CRUD blog application with a couple of interesting features implemented:

1. The blog posts will have a category, and in the application you will be able to filter the blog posts by category.
2. A slug automatically generated for you based on the title you provided.
3. Avoids having duplicate slugs so that you can even have posts in your application with the same title.
4. You will see how to have a featured blog that will be displayed at the top of the blog page.
5. You will see how to have it so that when you set another blog post to be featured, the previously featured blog post will be automatically removed from being featured.
